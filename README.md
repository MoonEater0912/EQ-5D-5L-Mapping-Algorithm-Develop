This is my solutions for all the exercises in the book *Quantitative Social Science* (ongoing).
- This book is written by Kosuke Imai, which is a very good introductory textbook for quant methods (especially focused on beginner-level causal inference)
- This book has two versions: one is based on Stata, and the other one is based on R, I am using the latter, which means all my codes are written in R
- In the file folder **Data**, there are all the datasets and examples appearing in the book
- My solutions are in the folder **My_code**, most of them are finished using jupyter notebook in vscode (.ipynb)
